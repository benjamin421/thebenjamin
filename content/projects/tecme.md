A marketplace that connects customers to vetted technicians. 
{{< /lead >}}

TecMe is the first spin off application created by members of the [WAND]({{< ref "wand" >}}) team using a bulk of the same infrustructure as our original app. TecMe is now headed by a past WAND intern and one of the most impressive young guys I've ever met, and backed technically by our CTO.
