Represents the optometric profession to government, third parties and the public in Iowa.
{{< /lead >}}

I was contracted by the Iowa Optometric Association to conduct a comprehensive audit of their web, Android and iOS platforms. My deliverable in doing this was a report of areas for improvement spanning technical updates and suggestions to improve site user experience on the front-end. 

I was then contracted for the follow-on work of implimenting a number of these updates, and troubleshooting some existing issues inside of the platforms.
