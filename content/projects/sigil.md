A sovereign payment processor built for creators to send and receive funds.
{{< /lead >}}

I was contacted by an adult content marketplace in an emergency scenario. They had been shut off by their payment processor. 

When they originally asked me to help switch them over to a new payments API, I asked why they would do this as they would be leaving the door open to have the same problem in the future. 

We ended up working together to develop and entirely new payment backend that would be 100% secure and sovereign, where they would never again need to worry about being deplatformed. 

We then continued working together to build a platform that would allow others to licence access to this backend for a small fee per transation, giving others in their position an alternative payment gateway to turn to that did not descriminate based on their client's usecase.
