A nonprofit organization that connects military veterans with new missions in under-resourced communities.
{{< /lead >}}

I was contracted by The Mission Continues to create a digital marketing strategy in addition to a set of Google Ads campaigns to go along with that strategy. 

The client had a $10,000 monthly budget through a Google Ads Grant that they wanted to use up as part of the strategy. This proved to be a bit of a challenge because Google doesn't prefer ad grant spend to usual cold hard cash. 

After some initial trial and error, I was able to get up a set of evergreen campaigns that helped to raise over $60,000 in donations over the course of our engagement. Before concluding the engagement, I was also asked ot create a guide for internal employees, how to get new campaigns up an running using my general strategies.
