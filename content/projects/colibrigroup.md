Building the Future of Professional Education.
{{< /lead >}}

I was contracted by Colibri Group to be available for developing new landing pages in addition to working on current website changes and enhancements on an ongoing basis.

Colibri Group is the umbrella entity for a number of brand and region specific websites. As part of this opportunity, I have managed more than 10 of these sub-entities spanning industries from financial services, securities training, insurance and more.
