I was tasked with community growth and coordinating numerous other marketing campaigns to ensure a successful crowdsale for this ICO(Initial Coin Offering). 

Over my time with them, I coordinated campaigns across Telegram, Facebook and Reddit that grew the community from 1,600 to 71,000. At the same time, this helped the project in its' raising of 3.8 million in white-listed investments.
