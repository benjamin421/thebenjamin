A marketplace that connects shippers to carriers. 
{{< /lead >}}

IGS Trans Inc. is a marketplace I developed independently over the Summer of 2020. The application allows independent freight carriers to sign up and once vetted and approved, accept shipments from customers. 

This is the 3rd marketplace I've been involved in after seeing what was possible building [TecMe]({{< ref "TecMe" >}}) using much of the same infrustructure as [WAND]({{< ref "wand" >}}).
