A community financial institution that wanted their lending team reinvigorated.
{{< /lead >}}

Through [Articulate Ventures](https://www.articulate.ventures/), I was consulted to help facilitate and organize a sales retreat for this community bank's lending team. 

The event lasted 2 days, consisting of team building and communications exercises, informative sessions and goal directed activities. This setting helped the institution to introduce team mates that had never met before, unify processes between disparate parts of the lending team, and build morale within the company.
