A VR experience built for a cohort of chief executives in YPO.
{{< /lead >}}

As part of a consulting arrrangement through [Articulate Ventures](https://articulate.ventures/), I developed a custom VR experience for a group of executives to tour as part of a retreat with this organization. 

The group who purchased the experience was [YPO](https://www.ypo.org/).
