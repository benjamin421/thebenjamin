A marketplace that connects hiring managers and talent agents to media talent. 
{{< /lead >}}

TalentBlvd is a marketplace I was contracted to develop in early 2021. The application allows media talent in the news sector to create profiles that can then be searched and filtered in a variety of ways by hiring managers and agents in this space. 

Another component of this site is a job board for talent who choose a 'premium' subscription that allows users to search for open positions that have been scraped and aggregated across 11 different job boards. 

This opportunity has tuned into some light on-going consulting backed by my experience running [WAND]({{< ref "wand" >}}).
