Below is an image of all of the people that will be attending along with you. There are 3 hot seats open for confirmations that need more time to give a final verdict on their ability to attend.

I am working on an itinerary, and will have it available when I send you a packet and some homework by the end of May. I will be reaching out to some of you about leading sessions during the event.

### Here are the details more fine tuned from my [last note](https://www.thebenjam.in/hidden/pattern-spotters-aging/):

**Retreat dates:**
- Friday, September 22 (12 pm start) - Sunday, September 24 (ends at 11 am). 

**Arrival times:**

- Due to out of state travel you are welcomed to arrive on Thursday, November 11th after 5 pm. Thursday night will be low key and the house will be open to make it easier for out of towners.

**Departure times:**

- We will be completely wrapped up by 11 am. It is approximately 1.5 hours to DIA airport so if possible, do not set return flights before 2 pm on Sunday.

**Location:** 

- Pending final selection from [this list](https://www.airbnb.com/wishlists/v/1172100636?s=67&unique_share_id=1ca11a72-d232-4e77-9ecc-69e2f9fef543), exploring additional options.
- *(Mainly trying to find a place where I can get a piano on site for Alex Trapp)*
- Use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15p0svrLiixVvnrrS3YebD6nmagRNjoWvbGjK8xW_T5c/edit?usp=sharing) to coordinate carpooling from the airport. 

### A note about my role at this retreat:

I have taken on this task because I live by the philosophy that if I want something in my life, I should be willing to create it.

I have had a dream of bringing together the people I’ve met who are doing unique work either in aging biology specifically, or who are doing something orthogonal I think offers valuable insights the rest of the space is overlooking. 

I believe deeply that the most valuable thing that will come out of this weekend is the interconnection of networks. You should all know that every person on here has deep value to contribute. There are no loose pieces in this group.

I am planning to be a full participant. I recognize that we need a leader of sorts to bring it all together, so I will fill that role but, I also want you to feel a deep sense of responsibility to make this retreat what you need it to be. Part of that responsibility will come in the form of "homework" to get you to think about yourself and share details about you that will help us understand you.

### What I need from you next:

- **Deposit:** If you haven’t already, please confirm you want to be here by sending a minimum of $100 over [Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/BenjaminAnderson) or [CashApp](https://cash.app/$Benjamin421). I have received a couple deposits since my last email and even a few of you have paid in full but I am still missing a few. 

- **First Homework:** You have all been included on [a link to a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m0eJdgQpISvReAU6Q9P6S4vJDF1GqHdafwHJK9NnuzA/edit?usp=sharing).
Find your name and answer the following 3 questions due May 31:
    - **Write a biography.** (400 words) This biography should include a small amount about your family, education, why you live where you do and describe how you spend most of your time.
    - **Give us a "photograph" of your personality.** (100 words) This should help us understand how you see yourself.
    - T**ell us what you are currently working on and how it contributes to solving the aging problem.** (100 words) This will give everyone some background on each other’s research.
    - *This doc has restricted access available only at the email address I have for you, if you have trouble logging in, [write me an email](mailto:me@benjaminbanderson.com) and I will help work something out. I have filled my biography out using the word counts as an example.*

I’ll be back again with an update including exact address, a tighter schedule, and more in May. I look forward to seeing some of you in either SF or Montenegro between now and then.
