More than 8 of you have responded saying that you were in for this event in one form or another. That being the case, I am officially moving forward on this.
{{< /lead >}}

### Here are the details reiterated from my [last note](https://youtu.be/7WDQvH8pMpM):

- **Time:** September 21-24
- **Location:** North America (Most likely somewhere in the Rocky Mountains outside Denver for centrality between coasts)
- **Transportation:** We can coordinate carpools if we agree to land in certain landing times at the airport.
- **Accommodation Type:** [This is an example](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/53145005?check_in=2023-09-21&check_out=2023-09-24&guests=1&adults=12&s=67&unique_share_id=540ff5d5-3a05-4db3-8866-4ece3f6eab0b) of the type of AirBNB option I’d like to reserve once I get 8 deposits.
- **Cost:** ~$500 (Food, Lodging, Event Supplies)

**Homework:** Provide feedback on the questions in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q004U3JeDkuEbef6dgeJiXsoetBouJj1fBrx84WgmXg/edit?usp=sharing). These topics are the types of discussions I hope to cultivate.

## What to do next: 
Send me a note to confirm you want to be here. 

Let me know before **March 15th** if at all possible.

For those who are still in, we will figure out something like [Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/BenjaminAnderson) or [CashApp](https://cash.app/$Benjamin421) to take a deposit for the space. I'll request $100 before the end of March to contribute to holding the location and once all expenses are accounted for, I'll poke everyone attending for the remainder a couple weeks out from the dates in September. 

The refund policy will be liberal, mostly I want to collect early so we have a budget and can start making purchases.

When you book travel, keep your receipt emails so that I know how much to pay back if we’re really successful with sponsorships.

**This is important:**
*I don't want anyone to avoid coming because of the cost. If $500 doesn't fit your budget, message me and we will figure something out. That might look like volunteering for a couch over a bed, taking a lead on meal preparation or letting me name your unborn child.*

From this point further I won't send any more messages to people that have not replied with an "I'm in" from this or my last note; if it doesn't work out this year it will work out another time.

Back after April 1st to let you know the final budget and attendees.
