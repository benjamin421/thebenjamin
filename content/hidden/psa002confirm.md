I am working on an itinerary, and will have it available by end of July. I will be reaching out to some of you about leading sessions during the event.

New folks are welcome to join our [Signal Group Chat](https://signal.group/#CjQKIHQIQbJWZjXZIbf3PwTMXZSrSOFnXBImjpBW9pPfb0UKEhCZXZv0O5gSrts5MqmLjhvB).

### Details reiterated from my [last note](https://www.thebenjam.in/hidden/psa-002/):

**Retreat dates:** Friday, September 20 (12 pm start) - Sunday, September 22 (ends at 11 am). 

**Arrival times:** Due to out of state travel you are welcomed to arrive on Thursday, September 19th after 5 pm. Thursday night will be low key and the house will be open to make it easier for out of towners.

**Departure times:** We will be completely wrapped up by 11 am. It is approximately 1.5 hours to DIA airport so if possible, do not set return flights before 2 pm on Sunday.

**Location:** 

- Winter Park, Colorado | [View the Listing.](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32846947?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=908758e5-946d-43ee-bed9-6d72f3cabeb1)
- Use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q-2bS21RQFOZOxW-VFCB4azpM0hW-9EG1GHmGMhfBMg/edit?usp=sharing) to coordinate carpooling from the airport. 

### My role at this retreat:

I am planning to be a full participant. We need a leader of sorts to bring it all together, so I will fill that role but, I also want you to feel a deep sense of responsibility to make this retreat what you need it to be. 

### What I need from you next:

- **Deposit:** If you haven’t already, please confirm you want to be here by sending a minimum of $250 over [Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/BenjaminAnderson), [CashApp](https://cash.app/$Benjamin421) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/benanderson421). All money goes towards splitting expenses, I do not profit off of this. Since we have more people this year, we will figure out the remainder during the event. The total cost will not exceed $500.

- **First Homework:** You have all been included on [a link to a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HFqFOA9Q42uZhl-PaUsKCIqI2TvFFd695VfMMcSKv9c/edit?usp=sharing).
Find your name and answer the following 3 questions due September 1st:
    - **Write a biography.** (400 words) This biography should include a small amount about your family, education, why you live where you do and describe how you spend most of your time.
    - **Give us a "photograph" of your personality.** (100 words) This should help us understand how you see yourself.
    - **Tell us what you are currently working on.** (100 words) This will give everyone some background on each other’s work.
    - *This doc has restricted access available only at the email address I have for you, if you have trouble logging in, [write me an email](mailto:me@benjaminbanderson.com) and I will help work something out. I have filled my biography out using the word counts as an example.*

I’ll be back again with an update including exact address, a tighter schedule, and more in July. I look forward to seeing some of you between now and then.
