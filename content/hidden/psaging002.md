Many of you have asked me if this is still on within the last few weeks. The answer is yes.

## Key Info

- **Time:** September 19-22
- **Location:** Rocky Mountains outside Denver, Colorado
- **Accommodation:** [This is the Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32846947?source_impression_id=p3_1717597416_P3H8dTPnaPK26PnP&check_in=2024-09-19&guests=14&adults=14&check_out=2024-09-22) from last year. I am inclined to stick with this one or am open to looking for a new spot to change it up. 
- **Transportation:** We can coordinate carpools if we agree to land in certain landing times at the airport. I will also lead another roadtrip carpool from St. Louis. First come, first serve. This was a great experience for Heye, George, Iosif and I last year. 
- **Cost:** ~$500 (Food, Lodging, Event Supplies)

## Invite
We will be returning to the mountains outside Denver, Colorado from September 19-22. Some new faces will be joining us.

The objective of PSA001 was to bring together a group of interdisciplinary aging researchers to spot patterns between domains of expertise and come to novel insights. 

We did so much more than that. We have created a high trust network. You've stayed in touch. You've visited each other. You've collaborated. Some of you have moved from across the world to work with each other. 

The social infrastructure we are building is what will lead to us solving aging. 

If you are in, please reply with "I'm in."

This is your commitment to being with us in Colorado in September. 

Logistics:
- Let me know before June 15th if at all possible. 
- Costs are the same as last year. $500 covers 3 nights of lodging, food and materials for the event. 

**This is important:**
*I don't want anyone to avoid coming because of the cost. If $500 doesn't fit your budget, message me and we will figure something out. That might look like volunteering for a couch over a bed, taking a lead on meal preparation or letting me name your unborn child.*

That is all for now. I will follow-up after the 15th with a confirmed roster and more details.

Be well. 

-Benjamin Anderson
