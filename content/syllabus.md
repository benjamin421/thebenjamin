The following is a compilation of the resources I have used to learn what I've felt necessary to guide my [research]({{< ref "research" >}}). The subjects covered here span biology, physics and the more narrow disciplines inbetween. 

Everything here is limited to what I've consumed. I wouldn’t recommend anything that I haven’t personally spent time with. That being said, there are a **ton** of great resources out there these days, so this list is far from exhaustive. 

I didn't include any 'popular science' books here, but if you'd like to browse the higher level things I've read, you can check out my book list [here]({{< ref "books" >}}).

If you have questions on any of the below, or want to talk about something here you've read, [send me a note](mailto:me@benjmainbanderson.com).

## Textbooks
*In order of what I read.*
- [Molecular Biology of the Cell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13400.Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell)

Many of the above textbooks are expensive, but you can find free PDFs online in places like the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). 

If you are under 18 and can't afford a copy of something you see here, [send me an email](mailto:me@benjaminbanderson.com).

## Courses
*In order of importance to my current work.*
- [Computational Bioelectricity (EE 123)](https://www.ece.tufts.edu/ee/123) 
- [Foundations Of Computational And Systems Biology (MIT 7.91J)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-91j-foundations-of-computational-and-systems-biology-spring-2014/)
- [Machine Learning A-Z™: AI, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) 
- [Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6) 

## Communities
*Great places to ask questions and meet others learning independently.*
- [DNA Deviants](https://twitter.com/DnaDeviants)
- [Bits in Bio](https://www.bitsinbio.org/)

## Tutoring
*If you have the budget, an hour of a tutor's time can help save you **hours** of independent study to understand a given concept or subject.*
- I've found [Preply](https://preply.com/) to be a great outlet for finding on-demand tutors for any given subject. Don't let the home page fool you, it's not just for language tutors. I've used it for [physics](https://preply.com/en/online/physics-tutors), [biology](https://preply.com/en/online/biology-tutors), [data science](https://preply.com/en/online/data-tutors) and yes, [Ukranian](https://preply.com/en/tutor/750854). 

- Thank you [Nick Cizek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ncizek) for the time & support in calculus. 

## Miscellaneous
- [The Sheeky Science Show](https://www.youtube.com/@TheSheekeyScienceShow)

[^1]: I debated whether or not to include this given that it is more of a 'popular science' read than a textbook. However, there are whole university courses structured around this book and so that let it pass the bar for me.
