The following is a compilation of the resources I have studied to learn what I've felt necessary to guide my [research]({{< ref "research" >}}). The subjects covered here span biology, physics and the more narrow disciplines inbetween. 

Everything here is limited to what I've consumed. I wouldn’t recommend anything that I haven’t personally spent time with. That being said, there are a **ton** of great resources out there these days, so this list is far from exhaustive. 

I didn't include any 'popular science' books here, but if you'd like to browse the higher level things I've read, you can check out my book list [here]({{< ref "books" >}}).

If you have questions one any of the below, or want to talk about something here you've read, [send me a note](mailto:me@benjmainbanderson.com).

[^1]: I struggled with whether or not to include this given that it is more of a 'popular science' read than a textbook. However, there are whole university courses structured around this book and so that let it pass the bar for me.
