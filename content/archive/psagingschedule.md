Pattern Spotting: Aging is 2 months out at the time of posting this. Just last week I was in Denver and so made a point of visiting [the property](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32846947?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=908758e5-946d-43ee-bed9-6d72f3cabeb1&source_impression_id=p3_1690297193_5PqSZrto%2Bcdotn9W) we'll be staying at in September. It's in a beautiful spot 90 minutes into the mountains with lots of nearby hikes.

For this reason, I'm writing to share a high level schedule for the weekend so that everyone has an idea of how much freetime we'll have for hanging out and to what degree we can expect to be spending time together for more structured talks:

_***I'm still counting everyone in this thread who's said they are in as 'in'. If anything on your end has changed and you can no longer attend, no stress, but please let me know ASAP as I'll be starting to purchase other items to prepare depending on headcount.***_

*There are also couple of folks who haven’t covered the remaining deposit since my last note. If that’s you, please send the reminder on [Venmo here](https://venmo.com/u/BenjaminAnderson) or send me note and we can work something out.*

There's a few things regarding this I'd like to cover as housekeeping items since we're nearing the event. 

### Food
You'll see that on Friday and Saturday before dinner, I have blocks labeled 'Cook Together'. Heye has graciously offered to take a lead on meal prep and coordination for the weekend, however to give him a helping hand pulling off our 2 biggest feasts, we're going to take that as an opportunity to cook as a team as its own social activity before we break bread together. 

*If you have any food allergies, please respond to Heye and I in this thread ASAP.*

### Transportation
I will have a car that can pick-up 4 additional passengers and am willing to lead one carpool to the house Thursday afternoon and will make one trip back out to grab folks if needed Friday morning. Please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15p0svrLiixVvnrrS3YebD6nmagRNjoWvbGjK8xW_T5c/edit?usp=sharing) to fill out your arrival information to coordinate with me or others. There are many shuttle services from Denver Airport to Winter Park Resort for between $50-100 depending on how many people the expense can be amoratized over. 

### Homework
- Fill out your member sheet for the event [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m0eJdgQpISvReAU6Q9P6S4vJDF1GqHdafwHJK9NnuzA/edit?usp=sharing) so that we can all know and look forward to meeting each other at the event.  
- Reflect on what you want out of this event, who you want to learn from, and how you would articulate your long term intentions as opposed to what you are working on *right now*. **What is something that you know yourself to be capable of that you are reluctant to tell others?** This is the place to answer that question with full conviction. 

I am deeply looking forward to this, and most excited to see those who will be here develop connections that will effect our lives after the event. 

I'll follow up in a few weeks as we get to 1 month out.
