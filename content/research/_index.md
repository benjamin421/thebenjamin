Subjects I am exploring through independent research. 
{{< /lead >}}

This section contains a brief list of research directions that I am currently exploring in my own [time]({{< ref "about" >}}). These are living documents, put here to make it easy for me to share my ideas with peers for context, and to be pressure tested. If you read something that sparks an idea, warrants feedback or something inbetween, [write me an email](mailto:me@benjaminbanderson.com).

Peer reviwed research can be found [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6213-1872). 

Here's my learning [syllabus]({{< ref "syllabus" >}}).
