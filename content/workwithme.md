The best way to work with me right now is through 1:1 [consulting]({{< ref "consulting" >}}). 
Typically for an hour a week or more, I will work with you or your company's decision maker to help come to conclusions about how to move towards a specific objective. Here I am not a laborer, I am a guide.

If you have a software idea/platform/gadget or gizmo that you are looking to have developed, then send me a note [here](mailto:me@benjmaminbanderson.com) outlining the project scope and I will reply with a bid and timeline if I'm interested in working on it. 

I have a sweet spot for [marketplaces]({{< ref "marketplaces" >}}) because I love helping users on one side of my platforms take ownership of their income and users on the other side buy back the one thing they thought that they couldn't: [time]({{< ref "about" >}}).
